# Calculating the Accuracy of the Model - Exercise Solution

This repository contains the solution to the "Calculating the Accuracy of the Model - Exercise," part of my Udemy data science learning journey.

## About the Exercise

In this exercise, we evaluate a classification model by calculating its accuracy. Model accuracy is a fundamental metric in assessing performance, and this project focuses on understanding its calculation and interpretation.

### Objectives

- Learn how to calculate accuracy for a classification model.
- Analyze the model's performance on a given dataset.
- Understand the implications of accuracy as a metric and its limitations.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this exercise contains:
- **Features**: Variables representing input data for the model.
- **Target**: Binary classification labels (0 or 1) for the model to predict.

### Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For dataset manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model building and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results.

### Key Steps in the Notebook

1. Import libraries and load the dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
3. Train a classification model on the training set.
4. Make predictions on the testing set.
5. Calculate the model's accuracy using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix (for deeper insights)
6. Interpret the model's performance.
